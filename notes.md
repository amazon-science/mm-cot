QCM: the model takes the concatenation of tokens of the question text (Q), the context text (C), and multiple options (M) as the input
QCM → A: No-CoT which predicts the answer directly
QCM → RA: Reasoning where answer inference is conditioned to the rationale 
QCM → AR: Explanation where the rationale is used for explaining the answer inference
